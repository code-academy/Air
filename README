Rails 3.1.1
Ruby 1.8.7

This is a sample app that allows users to:

- Browse the list of daily flights
- Create a user account
- Make a reservation (requires a user account)

Emails are sent out when booking a flight, so this line has been added to development.rb and production.rb:

   config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :test

This will make sure emails aren't really sent.  Change this to :smtp and provide the appropriate email settings if you really want to send live email.
